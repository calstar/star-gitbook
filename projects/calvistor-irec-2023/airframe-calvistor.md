# Airframe (CalVistor)

## Fin design discussion:

We designed our fins based on the need of our rocket. Initially, we had fin dimensions that were larger. However, as our rocket design developed we realized that this design was not meeting our apogee and stability needs. Each change would need our fins to be altered which was constant. After our rocket design was set, we began our fin simulations with respect to our motor simulations. We wanted to make sure our fins and motor complimented each other. We did different fin-size simulations for each motor we felt could be used to meet the needs of our rocket. After many fin/motor simulations and utilizing the optimization tool in Open Rocket, we landed on our current fin dimensions.

## **Fin attachment \***

Description of the method used for securing the fins to the airframe.

1. Sand areas of connection before applying epoxy. Clean off any fiberglass dust with IPA solution. Spread epoxy(JBweld) all around the bottom of the fin tab and side of fiberglass, so that it is completely coated.
2. Use the fin jigs to place the fins into the fin slots on the booster tube, so that the tabs are touching the motor tube and the aft side of the tab is touching the middle centering ring.
3. Create smooth epoxy fin fillets around each fin. After thoroughly mixing, wear gloves and use your finger to apply a generous amount of epoxy at the seams between the fins and the booster tube. &#x20;
4. Once all three fins are cured and attached, align the aft centering ring with the rest of the rings, but do not epoxy it in. Keep multiple zip ties wrapped around the ring so that once it is perfectly aligned, it can be pulled out.
5. Epoxy the aft centering ring into the exact position established in the previous step. If it falls out of alignment, use one of the extra aft centering rings and try again, until it is successful. Allow the epoxy to cure for 24 hours.
6.
   1. This step will also take place after fin glassing and after the aft rail button is attached.&#x20;

8. Fin glassing

General Procedure:

1. Roughen surface with 80 grit sandpaper.
2. Clean surface with 50% IPA, 50% water.
3. Cut 3 types of cuts of cloth:
4.
   1. First cut of cloth goes over the fillets, goes less than a third of the way up the fin, need 6 of these.
   2. Second cut goes up \~⅔ of fin, and out to the midpoint between the fins on the airframe, need 6 of these.
   3. Third cut goes from tip of one fin to tip of the adjacent fin, need 3 of these.
5. Mix epoxy in ratio given on instructions. Need a 3:1 ratio between epoxy and cloth.
6. Application:
7.
   1. Wet surface with epoxy.
   2. Put a cloth layer on top of epoxy; it will soak the epoxy into itself.
   3. Squeegee the excess epoxy and bubbles out of the layup to make it smooth.
   4. Once all three layers are on, apply peel-ply over the layup.
   5. Cure vertically.
8. Vacuum bag the entire fin area to ensure a smooth cured surface. Apply breather cloth to the peel-ply before bagging.
9. Once cured, sand down composite surface.

## Fin Flutter Analysis \*

Please describe the method and results used to determine the not to exceed flutter velocity or the divergence velocity.

We used the flutter boundary location to determine the rocket’s flutter velocity and ensure that our rocket’s velocity never exceeds this flutter velocity. Assuming our maximum altitude, which is the apogee of 10,000 feet, we were able to derive the estimated air temperature and estimated speed of sound. Finally, we were able to apply our fin geometry to calculate the fin flutter velocity, which is 1682.16 ft/s (1146.9 mph). We confirmed this value using the software FinSim, which combines our fin geometry with more specific rocket data to calculate this same value. Since our rocket’s maximum velocity is predicted to be 972 ft/s, we will not exceed flutter velocity.

#### Propulsion Narrative

Due to judges comments from our previous reports, we redid our propulsion simulations through OpenRocket. We used the RASP format simulator file from Thrustcurve.org. However, we wanted to preface a discrepancy between this file and the given information on the Thrustcurve site. For our motor, Aerotech M1939-W the written total impulse is given as 10481.5 Ns. However, the total impulse in the RASP file is 10369 Ns. All our simulations were done with this file, therefore using the impulse value of 10369 Ns.&#x20;
