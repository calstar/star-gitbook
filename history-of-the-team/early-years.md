STAR was founded in Spring 2016 by a small group of students who were interested in model rocketry. The team's core activities consisted of building commercial-off-the-shelf model rockets and launching them from Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Park. Additionally, a few members were working toward National Association of Rocketry Level 1 certifications. By the end of this semester, there were around 10 members. 

## NASA Student Launch - Fall 2016 to Spring 2017

Initial activities in the 2016-2017 School Year involved recruitment at the College of Engineering Activities Fair during the first week of school. After recruitment, a decision was made by the whole team \(around 25 people at this point\) to participate in NASA Student Launch.
