## September 16

### Evening Departure Logistics

* Launch logistics were organized a week in advance with a spreadsheet listing cars and drivers.
* No one shuffled between cars.
* Cars left around 4:30 PM on 16 Sep. Two left from Hearst Mining Circle. One directly went to pick members up and then went to buy groceries for the launch, leaving Berkeley around 5:30 PM.
  * In the future, we should purchase groceries ahead of time to avoid getting stuck in rush hour traffic.
* Stop made at Denny's, In\&Out for dinner & to allow the late-departing car to catch up.
* Arrived at Motel 6 in Mojave, CA at 12:45 AM on 17 Sep.
  * In the future, recommend departing earlier in the day (depending on availability) and stopping for less time in order to arrive earlier to allow for more time to rest.

## September 17&#x20;

* Departed from Motel 6 at 7:30 AM.
* Arrived at FAR at 8:30 AM.
* Began integration immediately. Integration completed by 11:30 AM but launch was delayed to allow for Michael Karish (former Recovery Lead and SSEP PM) to join a virtual call to watch launch.
* FAR officials did not hold safety talk, nor did they require a L2 cert.

#### Ground Test

* Not held due to extensive experience and testing in stage separation and parachute deployment.
* Ground tests may not be held during launches in the future. TBD by Recovery.

#### **Launch**

* Pinkbeary placed on launch rail and armed at 12:45 PM.
* Initial launch attempt scrubbed due to failed lower-stage motor igniter.
* Pinkbeary successfully launched at 1:46 PM after FAR officials provided STAR with a new custom-made motor igniter.
