# 2017-03-25 FRR Re-Re-Flight, NASA SL 2017

After the rapid unscheduled disassembly of Ursa Major, we had 2 weeks to fix the broken parts of Ursa Major, build a new payload, and fly the rocket in order to qualify us for the final flight in Alabama. With the Snow Ranch launch site rained out, the closest launch site was the Mojave Desert Advanced Rocketry Society site near Edwards AFB in southern California.

A big thanks to everyone on the 2016-2017 team who were able to make this launch happen. Special shout-out to Adam's parents, who hosted us overnight during our rushed final preparations, and to the MDARS folks for staying at the site until we were ready to launch.
