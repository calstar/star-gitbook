# Safety

## Working at the RFS

Many manufacturing teams work at the Richmond Field Station, a property owned by UC Berkeley and home to project teams and research groups with a need for space away from main campus.\
\
To work on STAR projects at the RFS, you **must** complete the RFS Safety Training and submit evidence of completion to us. See [RFS Safety Training](../../tutorials/rfs-safety-training.md) for details.

## High-Pressure Systems, Cryogens, and Flammable Materials

The Propulsion sub-team may require completion of EHS trainings and attendance at STAR-internal safety briefings to work with systems where additional hazards are present.
