# L1 and L2 Certification Tips & Tricks

## Level 1

* Minimize complexity to maximize your chances of success. In practice, this means:
  * **Consider buying a kit.** While you may have experience in HPR, designing a rocket from scratch can introduce more work and more risk. Most club members who have successfully completed an L1 have done so with a kit.
  * **Use motor ejection for parachute deployment.** While it may be tempting to try electronics, motor ejection is far more common in the hobby and introduces far less complexity into your system. Motor ejection is generally considered simple and effective. Furthermore, you won't have to worry about obtaining and preparing e-matches, black powder charges, etc.
  * **Don't use shear pins.** If using motor ejection, you will not have an \(easy\) way to ground test your recovery system. As such, using shear pins introduces a failure mode that is not easy to mitigate \(shear pins don't shear\). A simple friction fit with masking tape to hold together the two halves of your rocket is more than sufficient for an L1.
  * **Consider using an Aerotech DMS or Cesaroni motor.** Cesaroni RMS motors reasonably easy to use, but are in limited supply from our usual vendor. Aerotech RMS motors are significantly more complicated and require the purchase and assembly of several additional components. DMS motors require no casing, no assembly--simply adjust the delay, pack the ejection charge, and slide the motor in.
* Ask questions! \#rocket-design is our designated channel for rocket- and certification-related questions, but feel free to contact anyone you know who has gone through the process before. It's better to ask a question than make a mistake and waste $100+ of materials and countless hours of your time!
* Communicate with those in charge of certification, at _least_ one week in advance. The closest launch for STAR members is at [LUNAR](http://www.lunar.org/)'s Snow Ranch site; to get certified there you will have to contact David Raimondi \(see LUNAR website\). For those looking to get a Tripoli certification, the closest Tripoli club is [TCC](http://tccrockets.com/). Note that a NAR cert will be honored at a Tripoli launch, and vice-versa.
