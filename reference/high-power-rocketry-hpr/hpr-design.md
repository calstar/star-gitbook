# HPR Design

## Articles to Read:

Search \[topic\] + "apogee newsletter" and you can often find great results

* Specific articles coming soon

## Design Check:

* Make sure you allocated enough space for your parachutes. Too much space is better than not enough space!
  * TODO: how to determine/estimate packing size
* Do you have rail buttons? \(Most likely you should have 1010 rail buttons\)
* Does your motor mount fit the motors you plan on using?
  * The motor can be longer than the motor mount, but then the motor may take up parachute space!
  * A lot of H motors are 38mm.
  * A lot of J motors are 54mm \(but the BAR L2 special \[the J350W\] is 38mm\).
* Ground hit speed should be &lt;20ft/s. Is your main parachute big enough?
* \(For dual deployment\) Speed at main deployment should be &lt;70-80ft/s. Is your drogue big enough? \(TODO: should I say &lt;50 ft/s instead?\)
* Velocity off the rail \(our rails are at least 6 ft\) should be &gt;50 ft/s.

## Design

* Stability = \(CG - CP\) / rocket diameter, with CG and CP measured from the bottom of the rocket. It is unitless, but usually written as a number of “cal”s.
  * Stability should be between 1.5 cal to 2.0 cal. Stability of 1.8 cal is good.
* Tubing:
  * Fiberglass is expensive \(?\).
  * Carbon fiber is more expensive \(?\).
  * Blue tube is strong and relatively cheap.
  * Don’t use cardboard for HPR.
* Shoulders:
  * Recommended shoulder length \(i.e. extent of coupler tube\) is about tube diameter \(i.e. 1 cal\).
* Nose cones:
  * 4:1 tangent ogive is nearly optimal. \(?\)
* Fins:
  * Plywood is good up to around 330 ft/s. Above this, there is significant risk of fin flutter, which can break your fins right off the rocket.
  * G-10 fiberglass has flutter speeds of over 1 Km/s \(~3330 ft/s\), so for L1/L2 it should be fine.
* Tube size:
  * Hands tend to be less than 4” across -- so if you want to be able to reach all the way inside your rocket, 4” should be big enough.
* Fin mounting:
  * Sandwich between bulkheads.
  * Epoxy the shit out of the fins.
* Bulkheads:
  * 0.25” plywood is a good choice.
* Motor mount:
  * Usually a phenolic tube; may be fiberglass.
  * Design around the length of the motor\(s\) you plan on using.
