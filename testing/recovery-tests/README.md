# Recovery Tests

Recovery will be running a total of 7 pressure and ground tests to analyze the capabilities of the recovery stage separation system.

\
**SRAD Pressure Vessel Testing** \
This test is designed to confirm that the CO2 ejection system is capable of separating the launch vehicle in stage separation.&#x20;

**Proof Pressure Testing**\
****This test is designed to confirm that the launch vehicle is capable of withstanding a minimum of 1.5x expected operating pressure for no less than 2x the expected system working time.&#x20;

**Burst Pressure Vessel Testing**\
****This optional but highly recommended test is designed to confirm the pressure at which the launch vehicle will either be broken or critically damaged.

**Secure Connections Tug Test**\
****This test is designed to confirm that all safety critical wiring and cable connections are secured.

**Ejection Gas Protection Test**\
****This test is designed to confirm that the launch vehicle and its components, including the rest of the recovery system, are undamaged due to stage separation.

**Wire Cutters System Test**\
****This test is designed to confirm that the wire cutters system is capable of separating the launch vehicle during stage separation.

**Explosive Bolts System Test**\
****This test is designed to confirm that the back up stage system design of explosive bolts is capable of separating the launch vehicle.&#x20;
