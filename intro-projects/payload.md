## Introduction

The intro project is designed with three main parts:

1. A **general rocketry take-home quiz**, taken **alone** \(due roughly _1 week_ after assigned\)
2. An **aerodynamics/glider parts quiz**, taken **alone** \(due _after glider presentation_ in meeting\)
3. A **glider design project**, done with **mentor guidance** \(due roughly _3 weeks_ after assigned\)

The intro project may seem daunting, but don’t worry!

In addition to the existing resources on GitBook, all the returning payload members will available to help.

We will assign a specific returning member as your mentor, but please reach out to any returning member for any questions. Also, feel free to DM Payload Lead Pranav Jayachand on Discord \(**nuance\#1335**\).

We will also hold a series of intro project workshops throughout the next weeks, giving an opportunity for hands-on help. Details will be announced here and on the \#payload channel.

Above all, we hope that the intro project will be a fun and rewarding experience.

Checkpoints Schedule:

* By week of 2021-09-27 - Quiz Complete
* By week of 2021-10-05 - Design Project Complete

### Part 3: Design

#### Design Objective Outline

Our goal is to design a balsa wood glider that can be launched from any angle. Another team has already done the task of picking out the payload and wing. Your task is to design and prototype the glider frame, keeping aerodynamics and glider design in mind – a structure to mount all of the payloads upon.

#### Requirements

> Engineering is defined by requirements!

_**Materials**_

* Balsa wood \(**1/8in thickness**\)
* Research payload, represented by a rectangular prism of dimensions **3 x 3 x 1 \(in^3\)** and weight **0.5 lbs**.
* Angle brackets to attach the wings and stabilizers to the fuselage \([https://www.mcmaster.com/1556A26/](https://www.mcmaster.com/1556A26/)\) 
  * Download the CAD and make sure you design the holes for the stabilizers to screw in. You are not required to make an assembly.

_**Detailed Design Requirements:**_

1. The glider, when wings are folded, must fit within the space of a cylinder, 4" in diameter and 8" in length. You **do not need to design** the folding/unfolding mechanism.
2. All components must be mounted by non-permanent means. For example, you may not glue a component to the frame. One method could be to use zip ties/Velcro; if you choose this option, be sure to include slots/holes for the ties/velcro. **For parts with mounting holes, screws and nuts are preferred.**
3. Glider must be statically stable when launched from any flight angle.

_**Ideal Design Goals:**_

1. Ensure durability will suffice when undergoing launch, descent, and landing conditions.
2. Sustain flight for the longest distance feasible.

Your glider may be as elaborate or as simple as you'd like, but it should adhere to the above requirements.

### Designing in Solidworks

{% hint style="info" %}
**Checkpoint: Week of \[TBD\] \| Workshop 1: \[TBD\] see \#announcements on Discord for more information**

**\(Dates subject to modification according to scheduling\)**
{% endhint %}

We will use CAD \(computer aided design\) software in order to model our 3D frame. STAR has standardized using [SolidWorks ](https://github.com/calstar/star-gitbook/tree/5d8cf7302474743570b93a399b946d08b76f99ff/intro-projects/www.solidworks.com)as our preferred CAD software. If you have used CAD software other than SolidWorks, such as Fusion 360, Inventor, or Creo, then SolidWorks should not be too difficult to pick up.

If you have never used CAD software before, don’t worry! We will hold an intro project training class during Workshop 1, most likely in the week of 9/21**.** If you are not able to attend, there are also great online resources:

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtgmGkEPXs8" caption="" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
There will also be example PDFs for each section located at the end of each stage. Use them if you are really stuck!
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Installing SolidWorks

The first challenge of this stage is installing SolidWorks. The GitBook has a very helpful “SolidWorks Installation” page to help you with this.

{% page-ref page="../tutorials/software/solidworks.md" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**SolidWorks is only compatible with Windows!** If you use MacOS or Linux you have three options:

1. Use the on-campus CAD lab in Etcheverry 1XXX or Jacobs 10 both of which have SolidWorks pre-installed.
2. Install Windows and then install SolidWorks.
3. **Only if the above is not feasible,** you may use a compatible CAD program of your choice \(Fusion 360 is recommended as it has many online resources\).
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Designing and iterating with given materials

Assume another team has already picked out the build materials and the payload. As a design engineer, your task is to cohesively incorporate all the given components into a \(hopefully\) functioning glider.

[Glider Aerodynamics & Important Variables](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cNe9AxSGersEDoL0zMk6lVN3drbxojVC4Fm1IG2rofg/edit#slide=id.ge5e6739c0e_0_19)

With all of the different variables used in glider design, it can be very useful to create an Excel/Google Sheets sheet that tracks Fuselage Length, Span, Root Chord length, Stabilizer Locations, and Sweep Angle, along with other variables.

**We will have a workshop on aerodynamics and glider design**, so if any of this does not make sense, that is completely reasonable. You'll have time to ask questions and receive help from mentors during the workshop \(date TBD\). Here is the presentation on glider aerodynamics and variables for your convenience:

A good place to start designing is by looking at the physical dimension of the payload it must carry and ensuring the fuselage is sized properly for payload transportation.

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not have to 3D model the payload section.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Working with the tube

The most challenging \(and annoying\) constraint placed on many payload projects is the size of the payload tube \(the part of the rocket that the payload is stored in\). Learning to work with the size limits of a cylinder is essential.

In this project, your tube space is limited to **6**" in diameter and **8**" in length, a common size for a medium-scale rocket \(and the size our glider, DAVE, will have to fit into!\). It is often convenient to work with space envelopes limited by a rectangle, so the foremost important fact to understand is that **a 6" diameter circle will not fit a 6x6" square.** Your usable space is limited to what you can fit \(or [inscribe](http://www.moomoomath.com/inscribed-polygon.html)\) within a circle.

To account for the folded wings, ensure that there is empty space greater than or equivalent to **.2 inches on both sides of the fuselage** in the **6"** diameter.

![](../.gitbook/assets/annotation-2019-07-08-185531.png)

Keep this in mind when designing your glider fuselage!

### Step 4: Start designing!

That's all the essentials to get you started on your design. Remember, you can come up with anything as long as it meets the detailed design requirements. The rest of this sub-section lists a few tips.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any non-permanent mounting method is acceptable. If a part comes with screw holes, you are encouraged to design for screw fasteners. However, zip ties and Velcro are also acceptable \(and are the only possible options for parts without mounting holes\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To design screw holes that fit, visit the [Tolerancing GitBook page](../tutorials/manufacturing/tolerancing.md)!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your mentor \(and other Payload members\) are here to help, and if you're ever stuck or confused, please ask! Aerodynamics and glider design is very confusing, and there is zero shame in not understanding the material.
{% endhint %}

### Step 5: Additional resources

A detailed step-by-step design guide will be released later in the semester \(Although I heavily encourage you to try it out yourself first & ask any Payload member for help before consulting the guide\).

### Step 6: Manufacturing!

If all Payload prospectives finish design work before the first six weeks of class end, we will attempt to manufacture each of the gliders and fly them against each other to see which one is the most aerodynamically sound.
