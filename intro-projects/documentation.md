# Operations

Operations is still a developing specialty. The intro project should be a reflection of what a member of operations should expect to do. This adds to the existing intro project by integrating other parts of operations. It consists of three sections: documentation, safety, and logistics. It should take under two hours to complete. If any of the project is confusing or ambiguous, please reach out to Michael C. (Ops Lead) on discord.&#x20;

### Documentation&#x20;

Complete Overleaf’s 30 minute LaTeX tutorial: [https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn\_LaTeX\_in\_30\_minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn\_LaTeX\_in\_30\_minutes)&#x20;

### Safety&#x20;

Fill in a risk assessment matrix for something hazardous that we work with. Examples: fiberglass, power tools, black powder, cryogens. Include the following:&#x20;

* Risks: hazardous material handling, transportation and storage procedures of propellants, and any other aspects of the design which pose potential hazards to operating personnel.&#x20;
* Mitigation approach: – by process and/or design – shall be defined for each hazard identified.&#x20;

### Logistics

Plan out a club launch event at a nearby Tripoli/NAR prefecture. Note: This will take place on a single day. Provide times and locations for departing, arriving and returning, important contacts on the team and of those managing the site, and a basic packing list
