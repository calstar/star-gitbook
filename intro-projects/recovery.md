# Recovery

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the Recovery specialty's intro/returning project page! Glad you're here.

The recovery specialty is tasked with safely landing the launch vehicle. This responsibility requires working with constraints set in each project, attention to detail, and producing creative and efficient solutions. We work on numerous different components that are essential to the safe landing of the rocket including but not limited to: parachute size and geometry selection, parachute deployment altitude selection, ejection and separation mechanics, and avionics sled design. We require a general understanding of mechanics, electronics, simulations, physics, and more.

For any questions/help please feel free to reach out to Recovery specialty lead Michael at office hours or online through Discord or email. We also have mentors you will be assigned to as advisors (and friends) this year so feel free to contact them with any questions. Office Hour times are listed below. OH are highly encouraged if you need help!&#x20;

* Michael Karish | Recovery Specialty Lead
  * OH: TBD or ping me on discord
  * Email: michael.karish@berkeley.edu
  * Discord: michaelkarish

**Workshops:** There will be these workshops during the onboarding period:\
1\. Visual demonstrations of the avionics bay, avionics bay wiring, and parachute harness (9/23/21)

2\. Openrocket (9/30/21)

3\. Folding parachutes, folding shock cord, and tying shock cord

4\. General manufacturing.
{% endhint %}

## **New Member Project **_**(18 hrs)**_

The new member project for the recovery sub-team is intended to:

1. Introduce a **strong technical foundation** for the critical components of the recovery subsystem to new members
2. Learn to work with constraints, similar to **industry**
3. Encourage **collaboration/asking for help** to accomplish these tasks
4. **Connect** new Recovery members with returning Recovery members.

The deliverables of the project should be presented at the final GM of the onboarding period. Remember! This project is meant to be challenging, but attainable, especially if you ask for help. So please ask questions, come to workshops, and come to office hours!

### **Task 1 | Jacob's Trainings **_**(Urgent!**_) (5 hours)

**Due: October 16th**

**Deliverable:** Screenshots of completed trainings from bCourses.

The majority of our manufacturing will be done in the Jacob's Hall Maker Space. It is a great place to work on a variety of projects with numerous tools and super helpful staff. We would like you to complete laser cutter training, electronics lab training, water jet training, and metal shop training as these are the tools or sets of tools we use that require in person trainings. After this introduction to the Jacobs makerspace, you will no doubt use your pass for projects outside of STAR including personal projects and also some classwork.

**We would like you to complete laser cutter training and electronics lab training. Also complete at least one of water jet training and metal shop training.**&#x20;

**Apply for a Maker Pass by September 12th. This will not guarantee you a pass. Jacob's will let you know if you get a pass or not by September 20th.**\
\
After applying for a Maker Pass, you need to complete the "General Workshop Safety" (GWS) online module that will be linked when you complete the application. Then you will need to complete an online training (in the same bCourses class as GWS) for each piece of equipment you want to use. Then you will need to attend an in person training for all of the above pieces of equipment or sets of equipment. Trainings are not more than 2 hours. 3D printing is also an important part of Recovery but only online trainings are required for use.

Coordinate with your teammates to sign up for in person trainings together!&#x20;

**Contact Michael if you are unable to get a Maker Pass. There are other makerspaces on campus so we can figure something out.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** A Maker Pass costs $100 per semester unless you are able to get a fee waiver for demonstrated financial need. If you have any concerns, please let me or Michael Celebrado (Operations Lead) know and we can definitely work something out to help you purchase one.

### **Task** 2 **| Stage Separation Flow Chart **_**(2 hrs)**_

**Due: October 16th**

**Deliverable:** Filled out flow chart breaking down of each event of stage separation. Cover possibilities of both success and failure at each event and the resulting situation. Remember our main goal is safe recovery of the rocket.&#x20;

You can assume all separation occurs due to "pyrogen ignition" regardless of mechanism or type or charge. Don't worry too much about how the separation is actually occurring as the mechanisms vary. I recommend checking out Apogee Rocketry's basic breakdown of events, but please keep in mind this does not cover stage separation.&#x20;

The basic idea with stage separation is that it is more efficient for the rocket to fly up without the extra weight of a used up motor and the surrounding airframe so the lower part or stage of the rocket is released at a certain altitude at which we know the lower motor has burned out.&#x20;

Openrocket simulations are a good way to visualize the steps of our two stage recovery system. Download Openrocket (directions are in the gitbook under "Tutorials">"Software Setup">"Openrocket Installation") and then download the file linked below containing the most recent stage separation Openrocket file.&#x20;

Select "Flight simulations" and "plot" to get a sense of what is happening to each stage throughout the rocket's flight. The "Motors & Configuration" tab is useful for understanding when and where each parachute will deploy. Also in looking at the "Rocket Design" try to picture where in the rocket separation will occur.

I would also checkout the Apogee Rockets' explanation of a two stage rocket with "headend ignition". The separation mechanism described is different from our own but it is still relevant.

In understanding the recovery steps of Stage Separation, you will grasp the recovery steps of our single stage competition (IREC) rocket.

### **Task 4| Avionics Bay Assembly **_**(6 hrs)**_

**Due: October 16th**

**Deliverable**: A brief write up presenting your design (include pictures of the full assembly) and explaining your design methodology and decisions.

**Recovery will have Solidworks office hours \[TBD]**

Creating CAD models is a skill every engineer should have down and recovery is no exception. It is important to model things before manufacturing to avoid wasted materials due to poor design. Recovery designs and manufactures the avionics bays for all the rockets so proper documentation is needed. The avionics bay houses the altimeters and other necessary hardware that enables proper parachute deployment which is often mounted to an accessible sled. A typical avionics bay (av-bay) consists of the following:

* Altimeters- tell the pyrogens for parachute deployment and stage separation when to deploy
* Avionics Sled- secure the batteries and altimeters
* Bulkheads- create sturdy and nearly airtight separations between different sections of the rocket allowing for pressure build up when the explosives ignite. This is critical for parachute deployment
* Alignment Rods- orient the Av-Bay components such that the Avionics Sled can slide in and out
* Access Hatch- the opening through which we can bring the altimeter sled in and out and we can connect wires to the altimeters on the altimeter sled
* Batteries- power the altimeters

**You are tasked to create a full CAD model of a usable avionics bay to house 2 altimeters and 2 9V batteries**. We have provided the appropriate airframe and altimeter models that we frequently use below. You should create models for the altimeter sled, bulkheads, and alignment rods. Once you have completed all of the above models, make an assembly of the entire avionics bay with all the components inside and properly constrained.&#x20;

**Note:** We also require the avionics bay be CAS compatible, this is the custom made electronics designed by our Avionics specialty! It has the dimensions of a 2x2x2 in cube.&#x20;

* **Outer**
  * **Inner Diameter:** 3.900" (9.91 cm)
  * **Outer Diameter:** 4.014" (10.2 cm)
* **Coupler**
  * **Inner Diameter:** 3.786" (9.80 cm)
  * **Outer Diameter:** 3.900" (9.91 cm)

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Help Starting:** Check out the STAR Internal page on the Avionics Sled. Join **GrabCAD** to see the CAD work for STAR's current projects and last year's competition rocket: Bear Force One (BFO). You should check out BFO's launch proven AvBay and the SSEP project's AvBays to see what AvBays can look like.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** This is a open, free-form project. There is no single way to create an avionics bay. As long as you can defend your design choices, we will accept your assembly. This is the most difficult part of the project especially if you do not have CAD experience. Please see Michael, your mentors, or any of the other returning members if you have any questions; we want to help!&#x20;

### Task 5| Mentorship (3 hours)

**Due: October 16th**

**Deliverable:** Meet for at least an hour with three returning recovery members. Ask for any help you need on your intro projects and get to know each other.\
\
Once you decide to join Recovery, you will be assigned 3 returning members that you will meet with during the onboarding period. Meet at a coffee shop or somewhere else cool in Berkeley or on campus!\
\
If these meetings are not enough for you to get the help you need on your intro projects, you should definitely reach out to your mentors or other returning Recovery members for more help.
