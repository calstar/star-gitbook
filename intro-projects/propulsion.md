# Propulsion

![Ignition Testing for LE-165](../.gitbook/assets/ignitiontesting.PNG)

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to ensure that new and returning members research various parts of a rocket propulsion system from both theoretical and practical engineering points of view. The document containing the entire timeline can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy2l3JOKqw\_BGmBq33F0STwY3ups7bEq2XvbOAA-AiI/edit).&#x20;

Your project should be completed with your intro project group.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This project is intended to challenge you a little bit! You are not expected to know everything you need for this project going in, and it will almost certainly be necessary for you to ask questions and interact with the team lead, propulsion members, and of course your mentor. This is by design, and is intended to get you familiar with our workflow and asking for help when needed. If you feel intimidated by the intro project, please please please reach out to others! Everybody wants you to succeed!

## Week 1: Introduction to Propulsion

Our first meeting with be at the STAR general meeting on Tursday, where we will give new memebrs a run down of what you can expect with prop as well as a runthorugh of our current projects! Recruits are also invited to our propulsion meetings on Monday night.&#x20;

If you are not able to make it in person, please feel free to reach out to us so we can answer any question you may have, as well as set you up with an educational group mentor!&#x20;

The way the propulsion intro project will be broken down is listed below:&#x20;

1. Week 1 (current week): will help new recruits become familiar with propulsion as a team. You will also be assigned a project mentor and be divided into teams&#x20;
2. Week 2: will be where we introduce Solid Rockets, Liquid Rockets, and Feed Systems. You will:
   1. Be assigned to a group and a mentor
   2. Start readings for week 2&#x20;
   3. Work with your group to complete the slides for week 2
3. Week 3: will be focusing on Injectors and Thrust Chambers. You will:
   1. Present slides for week 2 to mentor&#x20;
   2. Start readings for week 3&#x20;
   3. Work with your group to complete the slides for week 3
4. Week 4 and 5: will be where you will get to work under a member of the prop team and be introduced to propulsion specialties of your choosing.&#x20;

You can view our week 1 slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ELVzyB-4RBtOOTk8soJIerAGa7zAK6LjjPjcKwEF6Lg/edit#slide=id.g147dd557f88\_0\_5). This week will focus on establishing a point of contact between you and your group, as well as establishing a meeting time. You are welcome to get started on the readings for week 2 and 3.&#x20;

Please fill out our form [here](https://forms.gle/agxxTCMhbVcqkshz5) so we can get your paired up with a mentor!&#x20;

## Week 2: Solid Rockets, Liquid Rockets, and Feed Systems&#x20;

Now that you have met the team and been assigned a mentor, it's time to get learning! You will be expected to go through the assigned material in your own time throughout the course of this week. If you have any questions, please feel free to attend office hours with your mentor, or to reach out on discord.&#x20;

You will also be expected to fill out slides with your group, which will be shared to you by your mentor. Each of you will be assigned slides to fill, where you will answer questions related to this week's readings. Donâ€™t worry about correctness - your mentor will go over the correct answers with you at your scheduled meetings.

There will also be an in person workshop on the LE2 feed system! We encourage you to attend, but if that is not possible, it will be recorded.&#x20;

* Readings:
  * Solid Rocket

## Week 3.

Like Week 2, but with a focus on injectors and thrust chambers of liquid propulsion systems.

* [Cooling methods](https://aerospacenotes.com/propulsion-2/cooling-in-liquid-rocket/)

## Week 4-5.

Now you should be prepared to design your very own very basic liquid rocket engine. First, let's go over some of the resources you'll have at your disposal.

* A video presentation series that Trevor gave in the Spring of 2020 which goes over a liquid engine design, piping components, how to read a P\&ID diagram, and how to understand procedures. Under Spring 2020 Feed systems presentations
* A presentation on feed system design, **you should definitely watch this one!** Under Spring 2020, called Feed System Design&#x20;
  * A pre-requisite viewing before this one is the Pipes and Fittings presentation under the Spring 2020 Feed System Design Presentations
* Everyone should watch at least 2 presentations, the Pipes and Fittings presentation and the Feed System Design presentation in order to aid you on the P\&ID section of the intro project
* [Video presentations here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1D6NbMThCN456255a8t0DgSJaBS\_EkZjS)
* [This tutorial on how to use Rocket Propulsion Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3W3zZj4zX4) (There are more tutorials elsewhere on this Gitbook)
* Of course, you always have your mentor, other people in your group, and feel free to message Trevor or Aarabhi.

As for your design, you'll have to present four different things: your feed system design, thrust chamber design, injector design, and basic procedures. These can be shared or split up as a team. I would recommend multiple people working on each component, as some are admittedly more exciting and interesting than others, but all are important for everyone on the team to understand.

If you don't understand what you are supposed to do or are stuck, please come to office hours! I will basically give you the answer to help you learn throughout this process.&#x20;

**Feed system design:**

* Which feed system type would you use for your design? Why? State some pros and cons of your chosen method, and present a runner-up method while comparing the first choice and runner-up method.
* A Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P\&ID) should be made for your propulsion system. You should watch the pipes and fittings presentation along with the feed system design presentation, both linked above, in order to learn how to create the P\&ID design.

Components to use in your P\&ID:

* Check valves
* Ball valves
* Relief valve
* Regulator
* T intersections/other multi-way fittings
* Standalone regulators and nitrogen tank regulators (if necessary)&#x20;
* Other components can be used if desired

Deliverables:

* A complete P\&ID for your feed system, similar to the design shown in the video
* A slide detailing your feed system type choice.&#x20;

&#x20;

**Thrust chamber design:**

*   Here are some design restraints:

    * The engine fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen
    * Oxidizer/Fuel ratio is 2.56
    * 1 atm ambient air pressure
    * A total impulse of 8000 N\*s is desired
    * Assume that the thrust curve is constant during the firing.
      * Hint: Total Impulse=Force\*time


* Design Choices
  * The chamber pressure can be between 250 psi and 1000 psi. You may choose any number in this range, but you should present the reasoning behind the pros and cons of a higher or lower chamber pressure.
  * Choose an engine firing time between 10 and 30 seconds. There is no wrong choice, but explain the pros and cons of the length of firing duration choices.
  * Which cooling method would you use for the thrust chamber? Why? State some pros and cons of your chosen method, and present a runner-up method while comparing the first choice and runner-up method. For your chosen method, in your presentation explain the heat transfer process, following the heat as it is transferred away from the thrust chamber.&#x20;

Deliverables:

* Chamber geometry: Using the Rocket Propulsion Analysis (RPA) software, determine the thrust chamber size and shape. Show a screenshot of the RPA results in your final presentation.
* Tank analysis:. Using the mass flow rates derived in RPA and your chosen firing time, determine the mass of each propellant required, as well as the associated volume required for your tanks to hold the propellant.&#x20;
* Slides detailing your choice of firing time and chamber pressure.
* Cooling method choice and heat transfer explanation.&#x20;

**Injector design:**

* Which injector design would you use for your design? Why? State some pros and cons of your chosen method, and present a runner-up method while comparing the first choice and runner-up method. For your chosen method, in your presentation explain with the use of a diagram how the injector promotes mixing together of the fuel and oxidizer in the combustion chamber.

Deliverables:

* A slide detailing your choice of injector type with the explanation of how injector mixing occurs in the design.&#x20;

**Procedures:**&#x20;

* Basic procedures should be written from a template for your system for testing the flow rate for your system.&#x20;
* Make a copy of the template [HERE ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P3gKRjy3aOpHa8Oy5DiH7qLSLG5nG873p8IAGObX3G8/edit)into your group's folder.&#x20;
* The tanks can all be assumed to be full of their respective fluids.&#x20;
* Denote what positions the valves are initially in at the beginning of the test
* Denote which valves turn in what order to start the test.
* Say that you only want to test the flow rate with a flow 5 seconds long. Denote which valves are turned to stop the test midway.&#x20;

## Final Presentation

Prepare a slide deck to be presented to your mentor, Propulsion lead, and Propulsion deputy. Anyone who wants to come and watch, including members of other groups, may also do so. A rubric will be used to provide feedback on every groupâ€™s presentation. The presentation is not meant to be hard, and putting in a minimal amount of effort is enough to complete it. The rubric will be used to provide feedback on the groupâ€™s design and project immediately after their presentation.

Good luck, have fun!
