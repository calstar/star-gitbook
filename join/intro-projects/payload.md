## Introduction

The intro project is designed with three main parts:

1. A series of **workshops** given at the beginning of the year to teach **basic rocketry and payload knowledge** as well as necessary skills (given the first few weeks of the school year)
2. A **general rocketry/payload take-home quiz**, taken **alone** (due roughly _1 week_ after assigned)
3. A **glider design project**, done with **mentor guidance** (due roughly _3 weeks_ after assigned)

The intro project may seem daunting, but don’t worry!

In addition to the existing resources on GitBook, all the returning payload members will be available to help.

We will assign a specific returning member as your mentor, but please reach out to any returning member for any questions. Also, feel free to DM Payload Lead, Tristan Steen, on Discord (**chaddusmaximus**).

We will also hold a series of intro project work sessions throughout the next weeks, giving an opportunity for hands-on help. Details will be announced on the #payload channel.

Above all, we hope that the intro project will be a fun, educational and rewarding experience.

Checkpoints Schedule:

* By 2023-9-14 - Quiz Complete
* By 2023-10-5 - Design Project Complete

### Part 2: Design

#### Design Objective Outline

Our goal is to build a mini glider that fits inside a 4” inner diameter, 12" long payload tube. Your task is to design and prototype a glider that can be ejected from the rocket for an unpowered flight to deliver a payload to the ground. Your glider does not have to fold like DAVE, but design the dimensions of your wing spars and stabilizers to fit in the payload tube as if it did. You will be responsible for designing your glider’s fuselage, wings, wing spars, and stabilizers. After that, you will build your design.

#### Requirements

> Engineering is defined by requirements!
>
>
>
> Tolerances are important, so consult the [Tolerancing Page](../../tutorials/manufacturing/tolerancing.md) on the GitBook when designing to account for manufacturing differences.&#x20;
>
>
>
> Listed below are all the parts you will need to integrate into your design. It is easiest to make the vertical stabilizer a part of the fuselage

_**Components to Integrate:**_

* Fuselage (Balsa Wood 1/8 inch thick)
* Wing Spars (Balsa Wood)
* Wings (Choice of Tissue Paper or Mylar)
* Horizontal Stabilizer (Balsa Wood)
  * If you want to try a tissue paper or Mylar horizontal stabilizer, design balsa wood stabilizer spars
* Vertical Stabilizer (Balsa Wood)

_**Materials Available:**_

* Balsa Wood
* Tissue Paper
* Mylar
* Tape
* Sewing Pins
* Super Glue
* Elmer's Glue

_**Detailed Design Requirements:**_

1. All components when hypothetically folded must fit within the space of a cylinder, 4" in inner diameter and 12" in length.
2. All components must be mounted securely to your fuselage. Glue, tape, and sewing thread will be used to attach components to the fuselage, but it is required that indents or cutouts be designed into the fuselage to allow components to be securely placed.
3. The wings and stabilizers may be arranged in any reasonable format (keep in mind the principles of aerodynamics when designing your glider and keep in mind the CG and the CoP).
4. Your glider itself will not carry an official payload, but a place to hold a payload must be included in your design. This space must be able to fit two quarters side-by-side (a 1.91x0.955" rectangle). In your final build, quarters can be added or removed non-permanently depending on the stability of your finished glider to aid in its flight.

Your glider may be as elaborate or simple as you'd like, but it should adhere to the above requirements, and should be able to be manufactured given the resources and parts that Jacobs and STAR are providing.

### Designing in SolidWorks

We will use CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software in order to model our glider. STAR has standardized using [SolidWorks ](https://github.com/calstar/star-gitbook/tree/5d8cf7302474743570b93a399b946d08b76f99ff/intro-projects/www.solidworks.com)as our preferred CAD software. If you have used CAD software other than SolidWorks, such as Fusion 360, Inventor, or Creo, then SolidWorks should not be too difficult to pick up.

If you have never used CAD software before, don’t worry! We will hold a CAD workshop during GM (date TBD)**.** If you are not able to attend, there are also great online resources:

{% hint style="info" %}
Feel free to reach out to your mentors if you need help with any of the below steps!
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Installing SolidWorks

You all already did this, so don't download it again, but all of the information for downloading SolidWorks 2023 is in the #info channel on the Discord.

The first challenge of this stage is installing SolidWorks. The GitBook has a very helpful “SolidWorks Installation” page to help you with this.

{% content-ref url="../../tutorials/software/solidworks.md" %}
[solidworks.md](../../tutorials/software/solidworks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**SolidWorks is only compatible with Windows!** If you use MacOS or Linux you have three options:

1. Use the on-campus CAD lab in Etcheverry 1XXX or Jacobs 10 both of which have SolidWorks pre-installed.
2. Install Windows and then install SolidWorks.
3. **Only if the above is not feasible,** you may use a compatible CAD program of your choice (Fusion 360 is recommended as it has many online resources).
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Working with the tube

The most challenging (and annoying) constraint placed on many payload projects is the size of the payload tube (the part of the rocket that the payload is stored in). Learning to work with the size limits of a cylinder is essential.

In this project, your tube space is limited to 4" inner diameter and 12" length, a common size for a smaller-scale rocket. It is often convenient to work with space envelopes limited by a rectangle, so the foremost important fact to understand is that **a 4" diameter circle will not fit a 4x4" square.** Your usable space is limited to what you can fit (or [inscribe](http://www.moomoomath.com/inscribed-polygon.html)) within a circle.

### Step 3: Start designing!

That's all the essentials to get you started on your design. Remember, you can come up with anything as long as it meets the detailed design requirements. Be sure to have your wing and stabilizer materials decided on before starting your design as they can influence your glider's weight and stability. Remember, if you need help be sure to reach out to your mentor or other payload members.

### Step 4: CAD Submission

When finished with your design, please upload your SolidWorks/other CAD files here: [https://forms.gle/h4Y89PrVZWnDM4Dr9](https://forms.gle/h4Y89PrVZWnDM4Dr9) (**Due 10/5**)

## Manufacturing

Now you start actually building your glider!&#x20;

Your fuselage, wing spars, and stabilizers will need to be laser cut out of balsa wood. To do this, your CAD files will need to be put into Adobe Illustrator in order to upload the files to the laser cutter. This will be done during the specialty meeting following the 10/5 GM. Your finished Illustrator files will be sent to a payload member with a Makerpass and they will get the parts laser cut for you.&#x20;

The GM of 10/12 will be your manufacturing day! Tissue paper and mylar will be provided for your wings (and possibly stabilizers) and glues, tape, and sewing pins will be provided to attach your components. Quarters will also be provided to add ballast weigh if necessary. After assembling your gliders we will go to the ramp behind Etcheverry and test them!&#x20;

Congratulations on completing your intro project!&#x20;
