# Avionics (in-progress)

## What is avionics anyway?

Avionics involves working with all the electronics and software we need to launch rockets. Sensors? Power? Communication? GPS Tracking? Remote engine control? That's all avionics!&#x20;

We welcome members of _**all majors and all levels of prior technical experience**_. The goal of this intro project is to go over some fundamental concepts and techniques from the ground up. All we ask is that you're interested in learning about, and eventually contributing to, the work we do at STAR

## Introduction

This intro project is separated into modules, each of which is expected to take about a week long to complete. You can complete most of the intro project at your own paceâ€”however, you will need to **attend workshops/ events synchronously.** (Exceptions on a case-by-case basis, make sure you inform the avionics lead to make other arrangements.)&#x20;

#### Navigation

We will use a spreadsheet to give you the instructions for the intro project. A copy of this sheet will be assigned to each prospective member.&#x20;

> **Each prospective member should receive a copy of the Intro Project spreadsheet, and be able to edit it. If you did not receive a copy, message the Avionics lead ASAP!!**

* **Task:** The intro project is made up of individual tasks you need to complete. You need to complete all tasks (except the ones marked \[OPTIONAL]) to complete the intro project.&#x20;
* **Status:** There are 3 options for status: Complete, In-progress, and N/A (not applicable). Use 'N/A' if you decide not to complete an _optional_ task. Use 'In-progress' after you have begun working on a task. Use 'Complete' only once the task is fully completed.&#x20;
* **Check Off By:** For tasks marked 'Prospective', you must update the status of that task by yourself. This lets us keep track of how you're doing on the intro project! Some tasks are marked 'Mentor' or 'Lead', you are _not_ allowed to update the status of that task until a mentor or lead approves it.&#x20;
* **Notes:** These may include some additional information or resources that might help with the task. Some notes cells will have a border around them, this indicates that there's some information you need to fill in there. (Instructions should be included in the corresponding task.)
