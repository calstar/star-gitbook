# Media

## **Task 1**

STAR is always striving to build better and faster rockets in our journey to eventually launch a rocket to space. In order to do that, we need sponsors that would help us raise money :\) These sponsors like cool visuals! Design a cool logo or image for our new rocket!

### **Media Portion:**

* Get comfortable navigating through Illustrator/Photoshop
* Become familiar with the design process

## **Task 2**

One of our missions is to get the STAR name out there. Ways to market our club to the public could include stickers, pins, and more.

1. Pick a marketing strategy -- stickers, pins, key chains, etc.
2. Design potential graphics, images, or other necessary files to accompany your product
