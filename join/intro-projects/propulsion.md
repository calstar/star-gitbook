# Propulsion



![Ignition Testing for LE-165](../../.gitbook/assets/ignitiontesting.PNG)

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to ensure that new and returning members research various parts of a rocket propulsion system from both theoretical and practical engineering points of view. The document containing the entire timeline can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy2l3JOKqw\_BGmBq33F0STwY3ups7bEq2XvbOAA-AiI/edit).&#x20;

Your project should be completed with your intro project group.

### Returning Members

Returning members have no special requirements for Fall 2023.

### Contact

If you have any questions about any part of the question at any time, do not hesitate to reach out to the propulsion lead (Eduardo) or the propulsion deputy (Sophya). Discord is preferred, but if you are having difficulty getting started with Discord, email is fine.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This project is intended to challenge you a little bit! You are not expected to know everything you need for this project going in, and it will almost certainly be necessary for you to ask questions and interact with the team lead, propulsion members, and of course your mentor. This is by design, and is intended to get you familiar with our workflow and asking for help when needed. If you feel intimidated by the intro project, please please please reach out to others! Everybody wants you to succeed!
{% endhint %}

## Week 2: Solid Rockets, Liquid Rockets, and Feed Systems&#x20;

Now that you have met the team and been assigned a mentor, it's time to get learning! You will be expected to go through the assigned material(below) on your own time throughout the course of this week. If you have any questions, please feel free to attend [Office Hours](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RtN5emHDT4Ztby0sD5t8LjnltecEHg-VsS011yhLepI/edit?usp=sharing) with returning members, or to reach out on discord.&#x20;

You will discuss what you learn and fill out a copy of week 2 slides([template here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EgcO5VNzixLT9-WuIbFNSjDEiqlWCZGGrWfWe6zRw2Y/edit?usp=sharing)) with your education group. Feel free to begin adding notes before your meeting(esp make use of presentation notes below each slide)... Don’t worry about correctness - your mentor will go over the correct answers with you at your scheduled meetings, and promote discussion of some of the difficult concepts.

There will be an **in person workshop on the LE2 feed system** during Prop Meeting on Monday, Sept 19th! We encourage you to attend, but if that is not possible, it will be recorded.&#x20;

## **PROPULSION TECHNICAL INTRO PROJECT**

You will select / be assigned a **technical mentor**(but can attend anyone's OH for help). Depending on what you would like to learn, you can choose who to work with, or jump across people's Office Hours to find the knowledge you might need to complete specific aspects of your project.

**Weekly office hours and meetings will be provided** by your new mentor!. Also, never be afraid to reach out for help - ask anyone you feel comfortable with. It is better to ask for clarification on something that might seem obvious than to spend hours confused.&#x20;

After week 4, **new members will host a design review** for their education and technical project and then move forward integrated LE2 member work.&#x20;

We will also be hosting several workshops during weeks 3-5! To complete your intro project and develop knowledge in propulsion specialties, please attend at least one workshop(really as many as you can) over these weeks.&#x20;



**Technical Project Options / Further Research Launching Points:**&#x20;

New members will completely own a small project on Propulsion, working to integrate your research/design/testing into the full-scale ELLIE and LE2/Flight propulsion projects.

(referenced are specific technical mentors that will provide direct project guidance)

We will cover each project idea in detial after the third week of introductory material.

Don't feel overwhelmend - You'll learn how to break down your goal into small, manageable portions that will integrate smoothly into a full project.
