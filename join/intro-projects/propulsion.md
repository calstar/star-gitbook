# Propulsion



![ALULA Hotfire](<../../.gitbook/assets/lwt hotfire.png>)

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to ensure that new and returning members research various parts of a rocket propulsion system from both theoretical and practical engineering points of view.

Your project should be completed with your intro project group.

### Returning Members

All returning members are expected to act as mentors for Fall 2023.

### Contact

If you have any questions about any part of the question at any time, do not hesitate to reach out to the propulsion lead (Eduardo) or the propulsion deputy (Sophya). Discord is preferred, but if you are having difficulty getting started with Discord, email is fine.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This project is intended to challenge you a little bit! You are not expected to know everything you need for this project going in, and it will almost certainly be necessary for you to ask questions and interact with the team lead, propulsion members, and of course your mentor. This is by design, and is intended to get you familiar with our workflow and asking for help when needed. If you feel intimidated by the intro project, please please please reach out to others! Everybody wants you to succeed!
{% endhint %}

## Week 1: Introduction to Propulsion

Our first meeting with be at the STAR general meeting on Thursday, where we will give new members a run down of what you can expect with prop as well as a run-through of our current projects! Recruits can also come to our propulsion meetings on Monday night.&#x20;

If you are not able to make it in person, please feel free to reach out to us so we can answer any question you may have, as well as set you up with an educational group mentor!&#x20;

## **PROPULSION TECHNICAL INTRO PROJECT**

You will select / be assigned a **technical mentor**(but can attend anyone's OH for help). Depending on what you would like to learn, you can choose who to work with, or jump across people's Office Hours to find the knowledge you might need to complete specific aspects of your project.

**Weekly office hours and meetings will be provided** by your new mentor!. Also, never be afraid to reach out for help - ask anyone you feel comfortable with. It is better to ask for clarification on something that might seem obvious than to spend hours confused.&#x20;

After week 4, **new members will host a design review** for their education and technical project and then move forward integrated ALULA/LE3 member work.&#x20;

We will also be hosting several workshops during weeks 3-5! To complete your intro project and develop knowledge in propulsion specialties, please attend at least one workshop(really as many as you can) over these weeks.&#x20;



**Technical Project Options / Further Research Launching Points:**&#x20;

New members will completely own a small project on Propulsion, working to integrate your research/design/testing into the full-scale ALULA and LE3/Flight propulsion projects.

(referenced are specific technical mentors that will provide direct project guidance)

We will cover each project idea in detail after the second week of introductory material.

Don't feel overwhelmed - You'll learn how to break down your goal into small, manageable portions that will integrate smoothly into a full project.



INTRO PROJECTS (More details coming soon!)

* Modular Test Stand for Feed System - Sophya
  * Goal: Design and construct test stand for feed system testing
* Cryogenic Insulation - Ricardo
  * Goal: Improve current method for insulating flight components exposed to cryogenic environments. Gain familiarity with extreme-condition mechanical systems.
* Ball Valve - Rotary Actuator Coupling Assembly - Andrew
  * Goal: Design system which effectively connects and constrains our main lox valve and actuator. Should allow easy access to surrounding fittings while minimizing weight
* Pyro Valve Simulation - Sara
  * Goal: Create simulation for fluid flow through ethanol main valve as well as perform FEA for pyro valve under pressure
* Feed System Tank Mounting - Brian
  * Goal: Improve system for mounting tanks onto feed system stand. Ideally easy to disassemble for prop system movement between flight and ground system while remaining sturdy.
