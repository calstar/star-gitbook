## New Member Airframe Intro Project

![](../../.gitbook/assets/img\_9630.jpg)

The Airframe meetings at the start of the year - along with the GitBook - will contain all the information required to complete the project. In addition, I will hold office hours, so please stop by and ask any questions you may have. If these scheduled office hours do not work for you, please feel free to reach out to me and schedule a different meeting time.

This intro project is broken up into 4 main sections, spanning 4 weeks

1. Airframe Terminology&#x20;
2. Airframe Project&#x20;
3. Technical Project&#x20;
4. Technical Project Manufacturing

### Part 1: Airframe Terminology

There are a lot of different terms and buzzwords we use in STAR day to day as we design and manufacture our rockets. The first step to getting comfortable with the team, is learning what all these words mean. For that we have the Airframe Handbook.

After reading through the Airframe Handbook, take this quiz.&#x20;

[https://forms.gle/j1k29X9hWzCTM9fr7](https://forms.gle/j1k29X9hWzCTM9fr7)&#x20;

You must retake this quiz until you have gotten 100%.&#x20;

After completing the quiz, reach out to your mentor and they will check you off.

**The Airframe Terminology quiz is due Monday 9/11 before the meeting!**
