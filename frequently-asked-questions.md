# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Who are we?

We are UC Berkeley's competitive rocketry team. We build rockets! Our mission is to enable students from all majors and backgrounds passionate in aersopace to gain hands-on experience through real-world projects. As part of STAR, members can expect to develop a set of valuable engineering skills, including experience with manufacturing, 3D CAD, simulation, project management and more. For more information, check out our website at [https://stars.berkeley.edu/](https://stars.berkeley.edu/)!

### What are the subteams? 

#### **Hardware Subteams** 

* Airframe

* Operations
* Outreach
* Simulations
* Systems

### Our projects 

**Ursa:** our entry in NASA Student Launch 2017

**Arktos:** our entry in ****NASA Student Launch 2018

**AirBears:** our 4" diameter test rocket, launched in Fall 2019

Check the website for more details, as well as our[ Launch History](history-of-the-team/launch-history/).

### Joining STAR

#### Do I need to have any experience to join?  

No! A large majority of our members joined with little to no prior experience in rocketry. Yet through our own passion and motivation, we have been able to create fully functioning rockets! While having technical or business experience is nice, we primarily expect from our new members two things: **passion** and **dedication.**

#### Do I need to be an engineering major to join? 

No! In addition to some of the non-technical teams mentioned above, one of our primary goals is member development and education. We have had a large number of members in non-technical majors do design, engineering, building, manufacturing, and testing of all different systems. With workshops and a mentorship program, we hope to teach all the tools you’ll need so that anyone who wants to is able to contribute.

#### Now that I'm interested, how do I join? 

You can check out which of the subteams interest you and attend their meetings or talk to the leads in-person or on Discord. Once you have a subteam you're interested in, there is an intro project that you should complete to join the subteam. The intro project is not meant to be a homework assignment or something you have to tackle alone. There will be office hours and workshops to help you complete it, and we encourage collaboration!

You'll find all the practical info you need on the New Members page:

{% page-ref page="join.md" %}

#### How often do you meet? 

Usually once or twice per week. General Meetings \("GMs"\) and subteam meetings are usually an hour every week. You might also meet outside of regular meetings for build days, design reviews, or other to hang out and gain subteam points!

## Subteams

### Airframe

#### What does Airframe do?

* Design and manufacture launch vehicles
  * Includes the structure, materials, aerodynamics, and stability of the rocket
* Help integrate the systems of other subteams 
* 3-D model using SolidWorks and OpenRocket
* Perform composite lay-ups to create [airframe components](reference/airframe-components.md).
* Use a CNC tube winder to manufacture tubes and other airframe components
* Mechanical design, systems engineering as needed

#### What is Airframe doing this year? 

We are designing and building the airframe for our 6-inch diameter IREC rocket with a target apogee of 10,000 feet; this includes tubes, fins, the motor mount, couplers, brackets, fasteners, and more.

#### Want to learn more about Airframe? 

Contact our Airframe lead, Christina Liveretou \(ChristinaLiveretou\#5880\) on Discord!

### Avionics

#### What does Avionics do? 

* Make flight electronics systems and corresponding ground systems
* Design custom circuit boards, flight software, ground station software for telemetry and analysis
* Antennas, wiring, and interfacing with other elements of the vehicle
* Electrical and software design, mechanical as needed

#### What is Avionics doing this semester?

We are designing and assembling the entire system architecture for Spectre. This includes flight computers, telemetry and power control, sensors, and more. The design cycle started with deriving requirements, and selecting key components, and moved into PCB \(Printed Circuit Board\) design \(schematic and layout\). Currently, we're working on revising the PCBs and starting to write firmware and software for our platform.

### Payload

#### What does Payload do? 

* Develops experiment concepts for payload challenges
* Designs payloads and collaborates on interfaces with other teams including Airframe, Avionics, and Recovery
* Manufactures the payload! Payloads are primarily composed of custom parts made in Jacobs and the Etcheverry Hall machine shop
* Runs through tests to ensure the payload suite meets all specs
* Science, mechanical and electrical design, software as needed

#### What is a payload? 

The payload is what the rocket is carrying, typically a satellite, scientific experiment, or even humans \(for larger rockets\).

#### What are some of the previously flown payloads? 

* Upright landing and target detection \(SAGITTA-VL ... no one knows what this stands for\)
* Autonomous rover including mechanisms to separate the airframe \(black powder charge\) and push out the rover \(scissor lift\). Rover's mission was to drive 5 feet and deploy a set of folding solar panels.
* Cosmic ray \(muon\) detector
* Sensor package \(pressure, acceleration, orientation, angular velocity, temperature, humidity, etc.\)

#### What is payload doing this year?

We are designing and building a whole suite of science experiments and sensors to fly to a height of 10,000 feet.

### Propulsion 

#### What does propulsion do? 

* Responsible for putting the rocket in the air
* Building the engine for the rocket
* Combustion, fluids, cryogens, mechanical and some electrical design
* Specifications for software

#### What is propulsion doing this year? 

We are building a prototype liquid bi-propellant engine. Design work in progress includes designing test structures, an integration structure, and improving parts of the engine itself.

### Recovery

#### What does Recovery do? 

* Responsible for the entire descent of the launch vehicle, including pyrotechnics  and parachute deployment
* Ensuring a safe landing of the vehicle
* "Jack of all trades" subteam with tons of hands-on work 
  * Fabrication, Electronics, Physics, CS, Systems

#### What is Recovery doing this year? 

We are developing a novel stage separation mechanism, as well as managing the recovery of all launch vehicles in development.

### Simulations

#### What does simulations do? 

* Responsible for Design Verification and Concept Check 
  * Using ANSYS, SimScale, hand calculations, and other computation software
* Simulating flight trajectories and fluid dynamics 
* Stress analysis and hazard identification 
* Analysis of sensor data from flights

### Operations

#### What does Operations do? 

* Manage and enforce team-wide safety standards
* Handle launch operations, checklists, and integration of the launch vehicle
* Organize and maintain our GitBook!
  * This includes both tutorials and project-specific documentation behind-the-scenes
* Technical design reports for competition
* Launch checklists, procedures, and [FMEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode,_effects,_and_criticality_analysis)
* Manage project-wide testing and verification of parts and systems
* Make sure the inventory is up-to-date and usable
* Manage CAD data
* Look into [regulations and law surrounding rocketry](reference/legal.md)

#### Why should you join Operations?

Having experience working with project documentation is a highly sought-after skill by employers of all kinds. Being able to maintain docs for your project shows that you are organized and capable of communicating your ideas with others. Furthermore, tools like checklists, FMEA/FMECA, and especially unit and integration testing are used heavily in industry, and the Ops team is a great way to get familiar with these early on in your career!

If you're more interested in the safety side of Ops, learning how to work safely with dangerous materials and devices can be a great experience for those looking for or already participating in research or work using lasers, cryogens, high-pressure systems, composites, flammables, etc.
