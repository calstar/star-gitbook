# Safety

## Working at the RFS

Many manufacturing teams work at the Richmond Field Station, a proprty owned by UC Berkeley and home to project teams and research groups with a need for space away from main campus.\
\
To work on STAR projects at the RFS, you **must** complete the RFS Safety Training and submit evidence of completion to us. See [RFS Safety Training](rfs-safety-training.md) for details.

## High-Pressure Systems, Cryogens, and Flammable Materials

The Propulsion subteam may require completion of EHS trainings and attendance at STAR-internal safety briefings to work with systems where additional hazards are present.

## Range Safety

When attending a high-power rocket launch, all members on site are required to attend the briefing given by the Range Safety Officer (usually before the range opens for launches). This briefing usually includes advice along the lines of:

* If you are watching a rocket and notice it has failed to successfully deploy its recovery device (usually parachutes), point at it and alert those around you by yelling "HEADS" or similar. The same applies to rockets even with parachutes that are descending near people.
* Do not approach the pads without an announcement from the RSO stating the range is open for loading and recovery.
* Do not place an igniter in a rocket motor before the rocket is set up on the pad.
* Do not arm altimeters until rocket is set up on the pad.

We also add the following STAR-specific rules, although a comprehensive list will be given by the STAR Safety Lead the day-of:

* Non-essential personnel **must** stand at least 10 ft. radially away from the rocket while black powder (or other pyrogen) charges are present in the rocket.
* All personnel **must not** stand along the axis of the rocket while charges are present in the rocket.
* Minimal personnel permitted while handling pyrogens; all others **must** stand 10-12 ft. away and wear ANSI Z87+ safety glasses. Personnel with no PPE must remain at least 20 ft. away in all directions.
* Personnel handling pyrogens **must** wear ANSI Z87+ rated safety glasses **and** a face shield.
* _Strongly_ recomment gloves (nitrile preferred) while handling epoxies. Deviation allowed only if gloves are not present / cannot reasonably be acquired.
* Recommend gloves (nitrile preferred) while handling APCP as it can be a mild skin irritant.
