# SolidWorks Installation

## Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
SolidWorks is only available for Windows 7, 8, and 10. If you have a UNIX-based operating system, consider dual-booting Windows \(see [Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) for macOS\) or running a virtual machine \(the campus provides VMware and a Windows license for free, but you can also use Parallels for macOS or VirtualBox for Linux\). Refer to the VMware/Boot Camp setup page for more detailed instructions
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before starting, make sure you have a fast, reliable internet connection and enough space on your disk. This process will download roughly 8GB of data.
{% endhint %}

### SolidWorks Student Design Kit \(SDK\)

SolidWorks SDK is a free version that includes SolidWorks Standard. If you need fluid simulation capability or any feature of SolidWorks Premium, contact a lead for a SolidWorks Engineering Kit \(SEK\) license. A comparison matrix can be found [here](https://www.solidworks.com/sw/docs/Student_Access_Product_Matrix_LB.pdf); 98% of STAR users are currently using SDK and all production CAD must adhere to the SDK feature set unless an exception is requested.

{% hint style="danger" %}
STAR is upgrading to SolidWorks **2019**! You may have multiple versions of SolidWorks installed, but please use SolidWorks 2019 \(also called **2019-2020**\) for all STAR work. Note that installation is _smoothest_ if you uninstall all other versions of SolidWorks before starting; post in \#operations if you encounter issues.
{% endhint %}

To download SolidWorks SDK, navigate to [http://www.solidworks.com/sw/education/SDL\_form.html](http://www.solidworks.com/sw/education/SDL_form.html). Mark "No" that you do not have a serial number and then enter "**9SDK2019**". Select the desired version from the dropdown. Fill out your email and select "Student Team" from the dropdown.
