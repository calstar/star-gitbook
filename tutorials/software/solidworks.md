# SolidWorks Installation

## Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
SolidWorks is only available for Windows 7, 8, and 10. If you have a UNIX-based operating system, consider dual-booting Windows \(see [Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) for macOS\) or running a virtual machine \(the campus provides VMware and a Windows license for free, but you can also use Parallels for macOS or VirtualBox for Linux\). Refer to the VMware/Boot Camp setup page for more detailed instructions
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before starting, make sure you have a fast, reliable internet connection and enough space on your disk. This process will download roughly 8GB of data.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are upgrading from an older version of SolidWorks, do not delete the old version and then download the new version. The old version can be upgraded.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The download link only downloads a ~32.1MB file named SolidWorksSetup.exe. A 7.1GB-18GB download will take place after following the instructions in the installer if a new installation is made. 
{% endhint %}

If presented with the option above in the installer, it is recommended to upgrade rather than create a new installation to save space.

On the summary page of the installer, you can select which products you wish to install. At minimum, you will need the 7.1GB SolidWorks package.

Instructions on downloading and installing SolidWorks Student Edition 2021 can also be found [**here**](https://files.solidworks.com/education/EDU_SW_SEK_Installation_Guide_ENG_2021.pdf).

{% hint style="success" %}
You should now have successfully installed SolidWorks! If you encounter issues, please contact a lead before moving on. Uninstalling, rebooting, and trying again can resolve many issues.
