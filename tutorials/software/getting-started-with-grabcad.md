# \[deprecated] Getting Started With GrabCAD Workbench

## 0. What is GrabCAD Workbench?

GrabCAD Workbench is an online platform to share CAD files and collaborate on projects, featuring version history tracking. It integrates directly with SolidWorks with a toolbar add-in and a desktop application.

## 1. Creating a GrabCAD Account

If you already have a GrabCAD account, you can skip this step.

{% hint style="info" %}
GrabCAD Community and GrabCAD Workbench accounts are the same
{% endhint %}

Creating a GrabCAD account is a straightforward process, first naviagte to:

{% embed url="https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/register" %}
Link to create a GrabCAD account
{% endembed %}

In the company details section, choose job level as "Student" first before filling anything else out. The company name section should change to school name; type "University of California, Berkeley" (or some variation thereof) in the text box.

Proceed through the signup process.

Be sure to go to your email to confirm the account.

{% hint style="success" %}
You've now successfully created a GrabCAD account!
{% endhint %}

## 2. Getting added to STAR on GrabCAD Workbench

STAR parts currently follow the set naming convention outlined at [https://rocketry.gitbook.io/public/tutorials/documentation/solidworks-file-conventions](https://rocketry.gitbook.io/public/tutorials/documentation/solidworks-file-conventions) found under Tutorials --> Operations --> SolidWorks file conventions. **All parts in STAR GrabCAD projects created after 2019 must follow this format.** If you have questions, just ask in #operations!

**Message the email you used to sign up for GrabCAD to the Operations Lead (@mcelly#1609) along with a copy of the previous paragraph on naming to obtain an invitation to STAR's GrabCAD page.** Let them know which projects you need access to, if possible.

## 3. Downloading the GrabCAD desktop application

The GrabCAD Workbench desktop application allows you to sync CAD files from your projects so that you have a local copy on your computer. It also installs the companion SolidWorks toolbar.

Navigate to the following link to download the installer:

{% embed url="https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/download" %}

{% endembed %}

Continue through the installation process. After completing the installation, be sure to log in with your GrabCAD account.
