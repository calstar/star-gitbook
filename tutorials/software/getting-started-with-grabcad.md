# Getting Started With GrabCAD Workbench

## 0. What is GrabCAD Workbench?

GrabCAD Workbench is an online platform to share CAD files and collaborate on projects, featuring version history tracking. It integrates directly with SolidWorks with a toolbar add-in and a desktop application.

## 1. Creating a GrabCAD Account

If you already have a GrabCAD account, you can skip this step.

{% hint style="info" %}
GrabCAD Community and GrabCAD Workbench accounts are the same
{% endhint %}

Creating a GrabCAD account is a straightforward process, first naviagte to:

{% embed url="https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/register" caption="Link to create a GrabCAD account" %}

In the company details section, choose job level as "Student" first before filling anything else out. The company name section should change to school name; type "University of California, Berkeley" \(or some variation thereof\) in the text box.

Proceed through the signup process.

{% endhint %}

## 2. Getting added to STAR on GrabCAD Workbench

STAR parts currently follow the set naming convention outlined at [https://rocketry.gitbook.io/docs/tutorials/documentation/solidworks-file-conventions](https://rocketry.gitbook.io/docs/tutorials/documentation/solidworks-file-conventions). **All parts in STAR GrabCAD projects created after 2019 must follow this format.** If you have questions, just ask in \#operations!

**Message the email you used to sign up for GrabCAD to the Operations Lead \(@mcelly\#1609\) along with a copy of the previous paragraph on naming to obtain an invitation to STAR's GrabCAD page.** Let them know which projects you need access to, if possible.

## 3. Downloading the GrabCAD desktop application

The GrabCAD Workbench desktop application allows you to sync CAD files from your projects so that you have a local copy on your computer. It also installs the companion SolidWorks toolbar.

Navigate to the following link to download the installer:
