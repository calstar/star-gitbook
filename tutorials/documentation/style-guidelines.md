# Style Guidelines

## General Guidelines

* Follow English conventions unless told otherwise
* Leave names of existing places/companies/objects as is
  * ex. AT\&T
* Use the spellings/names of objects common in the US as opposed to those common internationally
  * ex. Labor vs Labour
* Do not put a period after units unless other conventions dictate it
  * in, not in. or inches
  * 3 ft, not 3'
  * 30 mi/hr, not mph
  * 4 hrs, not 4 hr
* Nosecone is one word; not "nose cone"
* Do not abbreviate words with symbols
  * ex. &, @
* Capitalize proper nouns, but not regular ones.
  * ex. Nomex and Lexan, polycarbonate, payload, ejection subsystem
* Replace words like 'Payload, Ejection, Movement' with phrases like 'payload system, ejection subsystem, movement subsystem' respectively.
* Convention is to not hyphenate between latin prefixes.
  * ex. subteam is correct vs sub-team
  * ex. subsystem is correct vs sub-system
* A sentence that uses a listing system within it should:
  * have a colon before the listing begins;
  * have semicolons between parts, and;
  * use the ", and;" transition before the last item.
* Use --- in LaTeX to get the long m-dash used to separate parts of sentences.\
