# Submitting Reimbursements

## What is a reimbursement?

STAR is a Registered Student Organization under the Associated Students of the University of California \(ASUC\). As such, our funds are stored in their accounts and must be paid out according to their policies. Probably for better documentation and to ensure all money is spent properly, they only disburse funds after we purchase the items. This disbursement is your reimbursement. 

## How do I submit a reimbursement?

### Step 0 - Become a member on our Callink page

Only members can submit a purchase request. In the eyes of the ASUC, our official membership list is on our callink page. The following steps will show you how to get on our Callink roster.

First, go to our callink page here: [https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/star/](https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/star/). Sign into your Berkeley account and click **Join** to request membership. This is a one time thing, and will allow you to submit a Stage 1 Purchase Request.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need to wait for a lead to approve your request to Join. The finance tab will not be available until you are approved. 
{% endhint %}

![Click Join to request membership](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qhsd4c6_jbZ_QsvObwtVd4Zt8_wWfk9sOu8Ior8p64C9OESHCaHBPZjgztOoJSsWOcSVo5MAaN96NI79LdrEMtd7kHhGWAac2rAOh6Q_NIZd3fPULPZ7VimCIV2-aUPl5l1SKTQl)

### Step 1 - Submitting a Stage 1 Purchase Request

Once you have been approved as a member, again, navigate to our callink page: [https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/star/](https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/star/). Click **Manage Organization** in the upper right corner. 

![Click Manage Organization](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5dDY25fqROAaViQyX7G8Kb1IbCrowsYiapIo-KrLIFJwqlxzdUUL4QobK63KcfGCvZ58AhDjTqNUFcmXN1NCZV6YK-igVJM6iI5myo0clEmRQd52IDPHxoxl72lihhkQkg6EREs3)

Then, click the **expand menu button** \(**three horizontal bars**\) on the upper left corner . This will open a sidebar. 

![Click the three bars on the upper left corner](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yjbzSe5SZo50jccc2gkWTUbLmUYe2ydKgGklqd2hBabxl9U7xECA9bFe2FBG1UTUt_pfPZuEjJ6_sQUCpQvVsk9aeYakVwRm9r6dk76AZ29NREll0Kxth3yKDgmcV6hVLVAhL6z8)

Click the **Finance** option.

![Click Finance](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pj5P-BFyxQSFRKJaceKWBD4mj0kns7B1GFznopgwdWlvHAnU717kEYVKm_dWoycdpnf7JJS0ibSfi_sQ5dnlLWJE9Dk36L_M-6jEZyZ6QwvjUtfLnvqSiKQ0rF43BknegTg0qB_5)

Click the **Create New Request** button and then **Create New Purchase Request** from the drop-down options.

![Click Create New Request, then Create Purchase Request](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2885%29%20%281%29.png)

Fill out this form as accurately as possible. 

For **Subject**, use the format \[full name\] - \[subteam\] - \[item description\]. For example, this might look like: 

> Rajiv Govindjee - Propulsion - Test Stand Hardware

The description of items should be brief but descriptive; try to use between 2-5 words.

Refer to the table below for **Account**:

| If you are buying... | Use this Account |
| :--- | :--- |
| ~~Technical parts for the rocket~~ **DO NOT USE** | ~~3-62-203828-TECHF-Tech Fee-STAR~~ |
| Social supplies, outreach materials, or other general purchases | `3-70-203828-00000-MISC-STAR` |

For **Categories**, chose either **Cash Reimbursement** \(for purchases below $25\), or **Check Reimbursement** for all other purchases. If you feel like you must use one of the other categories, please reach out to a lead. 

![Choose either the second or third option](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

  
Section 5 \(Expenditure Action\) is up to you. For most cases, you can leave Sections 6 \(Event Details\) and 8 \(Special Instructions\) blank. Once complete, submit the Purchase Request.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mail to Payee-same address for 5 \(Expenditure Action\) is SLOWER. Hold for pickup is generally FASTER.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2 - Submit the STAR PR Form

Once you fill out the Stage 1 Purchase Request, fill out this form: [https://goo.gl/forms/cMOkLBXOFGwLEstl2](https://goo.gl/forms/cMOkLBXOFGwLEstl2)

The form above allows us to have our own financial records. The copy sent to the ASUC is not in a database format and is not searchable nor manipulable. 

The form will require the following items \(these are both ASUC requirements\):

1.  A digital copy of your receipt, invoice, and/or proof of delivery.
2. A digital copy of your credit card statement proving you paid for the item. \(you can redact all irrelevant information\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have physical copies available as you will need it to submit the final reimbursement request from the ASUC.

It would also be helpful to save the edit link to the form in case you make a mistake.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3 - Wait for confirmation from a STAR representative

A finance representative from the team will review your request and elevate it to a Stage 2 request. We will check that the amount requested matches the amount on the proof of purchase, and we will check that you have all required proof of purchases. 

Once approved, you will be notified through email or Discord. You can also check status from the Finances page. 

If your request does not meet our requirements, it will be rejected. Please check this page to make sure you met all the requirements.

### Step 4 - Print out and submit

Return to the Finances page, and print out your purchase request \(On finances page, there should be a print icon next to your request\). Attach physical copies of all the files you uploaded to the form. Staple it all together with the purchase request on top. 

From here you have two options. 

1\) You can bring the paperwork to the LEAD center on the 4th floor of Eshleman Hall and drop the papers off in the box at the reception desk.

2\)  Leave your forms in the folder at the front of the room during GM's. One of the leads will then take all the purchase requests in the folder and drop them off at the LEAD center themselves.

### Step 5 - Wait to hear back from the LEAD Center

Wait for approval from the LEAD Center. They may reach out to you for more details.
