# Ignition Devices

## Getting started

Generally, there are two classes of ignition devices in high power rocketry \(HPR\): igniters/starters, and e-matches. The former are used to start Ammonium Perchorate Composite Propellant \(APCP\) motors from a 12-volt supply on the ground, while the latter can be used to start smaller black powder motors on the ground, parachute ejection charges in-flight, and second-stage motors in-flight.

## Fully commerical-off-the-shelf \(COTS\) options

From the [Apogee website](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Motors/AeroTech_Accessories/First_Fire_Igniter):

* [**E-matches**](http://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Motors/Motor-Starters/Starter-Chipboard-6-pack) - While these are regulated by the government and require a Low Explosives User Permit \(LEUP\) to purchase, you can make your own from a kit without a permit. Order the [Starter Chipboards](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Motors/Motor-Starters/Starter-Chipboard-6-pack) and some special [igniter dip](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Motors/Motor-Starters/H3-Igniter-Dip) designed for low-current igniters. We also have \(as of November 2018\) an ATF approved non-regulated e-match called the [Firewire Initiator](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Motors/Motor-Starters/Firewire-Initiator-6-pk) and the [Firewire Mini](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Motors/Motor-Starters/Firewire-Mini-Initiator-6-pk) that does not require a LEUP! This would be the primary choice if you didn't want to dip your own Starter Chipboards.

### Chipboards

This part usually contains a nichrome wire that heats up when current is passed through them.

### Pyrogen

This is the part that burns. Apogee sells the [H-3 Compound E-match Dip](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Motors/Motor-Starters/H3-Igniter-Dip) for making e-matches \(low-current, low-voltage, to ignite black powder usually\) and [QuickDip Pyrogen](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Motors/Motor_Starters/QuickDip) for longer-burning starters \(starting APCP motors on the ground or in the air with high current\).
