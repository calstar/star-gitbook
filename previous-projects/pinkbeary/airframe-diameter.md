  Deciding the diameter of this rocket was a very important task. We wanted this
  rocket to be cost affective and aerodynamic, but also versatile.

## Conclusion

We decided that a 5.5 inch diameter rocket would be most beneficial. While this option is not the least expensive, it does allow for future growth. Although a 5.5 inch diameter rocket reaches a lower apogee than a 6 inch rocket and can carry less payload, we decided it is more beneficial for us as a club to understand the process of building and launching a dual stage rocket than it is to overdo our first attempt. A 5.5 inch stage separation rocket is not too risky, but will also allow us to use larger motors and reach higher altitudes in future launches. This rocket will help us gain experience in designing, manufacturing, and launching a dual stage rocket. This will be beneficial overall for the club and our long term goal of achieving a space shot.
