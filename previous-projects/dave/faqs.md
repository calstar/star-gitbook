# FAQ's

## Is this FAQ a good place for writing technical design decisions?

Heck no! There are other places to do that.

## What's the point of DAVE?

Payloads such as the muon detector benefit from extended time in the air. Other potential payloads may benefit from a more gentle descent, or placement in a specific location. Additionally, DAVE-specific payloads may be interesting, such as aerial mapping, rocket-spotting, etc.

## Why not just like, build an RC plane?

Getting a conventional UAS to this altitude can actually be quite difficult at this scale. While it is certainly doable, there may be applications for this sort of vehicle in a situation where rapid response and having a presence at these altitudes is important. The autonomous functionality is critical in these scenarios. For example, while fighting a fire, being able to quickly get a picture from the sky may be useful for firefighters on the ground.

## I have a cool idea for a payload that should go on DAVE. What should I do?

Write it down on the Trello card and message in #payload-dave! Even if we are actively focusing on IREC payloads, we can always be writing down good and interesting ideas.
