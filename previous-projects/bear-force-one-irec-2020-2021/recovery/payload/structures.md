# Structures

## Ballast

## Primary Payload Structure

### Tie-down rods

Purpose: To constrain the payload structure along the long axis of the rocket

Important design considerations:

* We used flight data and openrocket simulations to estimate maximum acceleration loads at 16 g's
* Two #4 threaded rods are spec'ed to a FOS of ?????
* @Ritvik something about having two possible orientations to minimize issues in assembly

What we have one:

* Complete test fit of design

What is left to be done:

* Add to launch-day parts list

### Lateral support system (i.e. leaf springs)

## GPS Mounting

GPS mounting is designed to attach the GPS module on the inside of the nosecone. In the designing process, two important factors were considered, stability, and suitability. Also, there were restrictions which are the GPS mounting can't touch the top metal plate of the structure and the GPS antenna should be mounted straight.

For higher stability of the GPS module, mounting has 6 zip tie holes on the front. There are two ways to fix the battery and GPS module into the mounting.\
1\) Using zip tie, combine together battery and GPS module.\
2\) Or, insert the battery and the GPS module into the mounting and tied them up together.\
The GPS mounting and holes are small, so a tweezer is needed to assemble it.

For the suitability of the mounting, the rear side of the mounting is designed with the same curvature as the inside of the nosecone. Also, the curvature was measured at 10.5 inch far from the top plate of the primary payload structure.&#x20;

ASSEMBLY

1. Place 4 long t-slot rails on each corner of the top base plate.&#x20;
2. Attach rails to base plate through 2 L brackets on each corner of base plate.
3. Using 2 M3x10 screws and 2 hex nuts on each corner, fasten each screw with all screw heads facing out of the opposite side of the t-slot rails.&#x20;
4. Using 2 nut plates and 2 cap screws on each corner, attach other end of L bracket to t-slot rails by connecting nut plate through t-slot rail and screwing through the hole of the L bracket with cap screw.
5. Attach MFC payload in payload structure.&#x20;
6. Push 4 cap screws through each leaf spring and screw on nut plate to each side of leaf spring.&#x20;
7. Slide leaf spring through t-slot rails until top of leafspring is 0.9” from top of t-slot rail.
8. Repeat step 7 for each side of structure (4 total).&#x20;
9. Repeat step 3 and 4 on other end of t-slot rails.
10. Attach center base plate to the top of t-slot rails by placing M3x10 screw through L bracket hole with screw head on same side of t-slot rails and hold.&#x20;
11. Place L bracket through end of screw with tall end facing corner and tighten with hex nut.&#x20;
12. Repeat steps 10 and 11 for each L bracket.
13. Repeat steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 with each corner of center base plate.&#x20;
14. Repeat steps 3 and 4 on top of t-slot rails, instead letting drop to bottom of t-slot rails.
15. Hang 32 ballast plates on the bottom brackets.
16. Push the M3x35 screw through slots of ballast, ensuring the screw heads point towards open end of structure.
17. Secure the ballast by tightening hex nuts on opposite end of each M3x35 screw.
18. Attach Stabilization payload to structure.&#x20;
19. Repeat steps 3 and 4 on top of t-slot rails.&#x20;
20. Repeat steps 10, 11, 12, and 13, instead using the shorter t-slot rails.
21. Attach IRIS/Muons payload to structure.&#x20;
22. Repeat steps 3 and 4 on top t-slot rails.
23. Place top bulkhead on top of t-slot rails.
24. Push M3x20 screws through L brackets with screw heads facing opposite the t-slot rails and fasten with M3 hex nuts.
25. Place wooden spacer on top of top bulkhead.
26. Place bottom bulkhead on top of wooden spacer.&#x20;
27. Turn entire structure on its side so that t-slot rails are horizontal.
28. Push tie down rod through slit on the top base plate, through entire structure, and stopping once it is through the bottom bulkhead.&#x20;
29. Repeat step 28 with the other side of the structure.
30. Screw hex nuts onto each end of tie down rods, tightening until the structure has tension.&#x20;
31. Flip structure so that it is resting on the bottom bulkhead.
