# Payload Subsystem Report

This report is intended to be used as a reference for all IREC 2020 payloads, as a preliminary description of all projects.

**Excerpt (Abstract):**

The Payload subteam of Space Technologies And Rocketry (STAR) at the University of California, Berkeley focuses on launching scientific instruments and experiments to high altitude: we are what makes rockets worth flying. This academic year, the payload projects, all integrated into a 5U CubeSat payload structure, include: onboard cameras, a dual sensor suite and cosmic particle detector, a microbial fuel cell, and an active stabilization system. The overarching mission objective is to record data and test experimental systems in-flight.
