# Prop Module

The prop module is currently still in development. The prop module is unique in that it consists of three boards, not one, since the components would not all fit on one board. Also, the prop module requires a separate power supply connector because one of the components (a solenoid) requires a +24V power input, which is greater than the battery can supply.

The current plan for the prop board will include connectors that attach to several sensors and actuators used in the propulsion system. These sensors and actuators are not on the boards themselves, but are instead wired to the connectors on the edges of the boards.

The main specifications for this module are:

* 5 Pressure Transducers
* 3 Load Cells
* 3 Thermocouples
* 3 Servos
* 2 Solenoids (to open valves)
* Oxygen Flow Meter (Not yet decided if we should include this)
